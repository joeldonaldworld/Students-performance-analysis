## **Title**
**Identifying Key Factors Influencing Student Exam Performance**

## **Description**
Student academic performance is a complex outcome influenced by various factors. This study analyzes student exam scores data to identify key variables that significantly impact student achievement. Understanding these factors will provide valuable insights for educators, parents, policymakers, and students to improve learning outcomes.

## **Objective**
To investigate the relationship between student exam scores and a range of potential influencing variables.

## **Data Source**
- **Source:** Kaggle

## **Methodology**
### **Data Collection**
- The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and included multiple variables such as student attendance, study hours, access to resources, and parental involvement.

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Missing values were handled by removing blank rows under critical columns.
- Data was standardized and formatted for consistency.
- Outliers were identified and addressed where necessary.

### **Data Analysis Techniques**
- Descriptive statistics were used to understand the distribution of student scores.
- Correlation analysis was performed to identify relationships between variables.
- Data visualization techniques, such as bar charts and scatter plots, were used to present key insights.
- Machine learning models were explored for predictive insights into student performance.

## **Observations**
1. Attendance had the greatest impact on students’ scores.
2. Study hours had the second greatest impact on students’ scores.
3. Access to resources had the third greatest impact on students’ scores.
4. Parental involvement had the fourth greatest impact on students’ scores.
5. The number of students without internet access is extremely high.
6. Only a few students studied for long hours, but those who did performed extremely well in their exams.

## **Solutions and Recommendations**
### **1. Address Internet Access**
- Establish computer labs with high-speed internet access.
- Partner with community centers or libraries to provide free internet access.
- Educate students and parents on digital literacy and safe internet usage.

### **2. Encourage Consistent Study Habits**
- Provide resources such as study guides, online learning platforms, and mobile apps.
- Encourage the use of study groups and peer learning.
- Provide quiet study spaces within the school.
- Offer after-school tutoring and homework help sessions.

### **3. Enhance Access to Resources**
- Increase the number of books, journals, and other learning materials.
- Ensure libraries are well-maintained and equipped with technology.

### **4. Strengthen Parental Involvement**
- Organize workshops on topics such as effective parenting strategies, supporting student learning at home, and understanding the educational system.
- Create opportunities for parents to volunteer in the classroom, at school events, and in the community.

### **5. Improve Attendance**
- Investigate and address potential barriers to attendance, such as:
  - Poverty
  - Health issues
  - Transportation challenges
  - Bullying and harassment
- Develop strategies to identify and support students at risk of chronic absenteeism.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Power BI
- Excel

## **Conclusion**
This analysis highlights critical factors influencing student performance, with attendance, study habits, and resource availability playing major roles. Addressing these challenges through targeted solutions will significantly improve academic outcomes. Future research could explore additional variables such as teacher effectiveness and curriculum impact to deepen the understanding of student performance dynamics.
